Shutdown/Start VMs by tag
=========================

            

This script shutdowns/starts VMs by a given tag and its value.




If you don't have it, you have to create a Credential Asset with the name **DefaultAzureCredential** in order to access your account. 
You can know more about this script here: [https://www.returngis.net/2016/07/por-que-etiquetar-tus-recursos-en-microsoft-azure/](https://www.returngis.net/2016/07/por-que-etiquetar-tus-recursos-en-microsoft-azure/)
Any comment would be appreciated :)

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
